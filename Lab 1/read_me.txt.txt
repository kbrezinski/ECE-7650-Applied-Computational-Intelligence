1. Open "Project_1_exercise_2.pdf" for answer to Q.1 (Source code found in livescript Project_1_exercise_2.mlx)

2. Open "Project_1_exercise_3.pdf" for answer to Q.2 (Source code found in livescript Project_1_exercise_3.mlx)

3. Open main.m for answer to Q.3
	3.1 main.m is default to 50 epochs at a learning rate of 0.07. It can be changed in the class call regressor_object()
	3.2 changing the total epochs to 500,000 will print the final error, which is aroud 20
	3.3 graph is automatically displayed in call of class method "plot_graph()", but is also found in d2noisy.png
